v0.03 20071111
- Packaging changes only, no need to upgrade
- Added missing prerequisite Class::Accessor
- Realized that the order of headers cannot be fixed
  without rewriting deep parts of LWP because those
  parts cannot be changed by containment
  or inheritance

v0.02 20051019
- Tried to fix TODO header-order test
- Header-order test had the wrong expected results anyway

v0.01 20051018
- The module escapes
